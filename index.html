            <h4>AIs and Javascript games</h4>
            <p>Here I will provide links to simple javascript games I've created, with AIs created either using a genetic algorithm or machine learning.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="./smart_particles/index.html" target="_blank">Smart particles</a>: The goal of the particles is the reach the goal (green circle). 
                You can choose level using the select element and change the speed using the slider. The red particle is the best of the previous generation.
                <p>
                    <strong>Genetic algorithm:</strong>  The "genes" of the particles are directions at a certain time frame. 
                    The genes are passed on the next generation mimicking "survival of the fitteest".
                    In the end, the particles have basically memorized the path to the goal by trial and error.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Machine learning:</strong> The input for the machine learning algorithm is in which direction the goal is,
                    as well as their distance to walls in the direction their facing as well as left and right.
                    In contrary to the genetic algorithm, where the path is memorized, the particles can learn to find a randomly moving target.

            <li><a href="./shooting-game/index.html" target="_blank">Shooting game</a>
            <p><strong>Play yourself:</strong> Use the spacebar and the left/right arrows to play. Shoot the circles before they hit the ground.</p>
            <p><strong>Machine leaerning:</strong> A neural network learns to play the game using a neuroevolution machine learning algorithm.</p>
